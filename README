# FinalProject
This is my final project for CS1410 (Object-Oriented Java). I created a game of Blackjack with a few extra features.

In this project I demonstrate an understanding of...

- Data structures (Arrays, ArrayLists, HashMaps)
- Reading/writing user data to files securely by implementing password encryption
- Using an interactive GUI with JFrame & JPanel
- Utilizing a UML class diagram
- Object inheritance
